  Usage:

    $ broker <command> [flags]

  This will run the Snyk broker that allows requests to be proxied to your
  internal environment, using controls to configure what types of
  requests are allowed and to what end point.

  The broker outputs logs in single-line JSON form to `stdout`. By default,
  the broker runs with `info` level logging. Set the desired logging verbosity
  by setting the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to one of the following:
  `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`. Only the selected log level and UP
  will be logged.

  Commands:
    client .............. run the broker in client mode
    server .............. run the broker in server mode
    init <template> ..... generate the client broker files required
                          for a given template. Supported templates:
                          github-com, github-enterprise, bitbucket-server,
                          gitlab

  Flags:

    -h, --help ........... this help
    -v, --version ........ current version

  Options:

    --port PORT .......... specify a local port for the broker to
                           listen on, defaults to port 7341

  Example:

    $ broker client --port 8000
