# How to contact us

Please send any issue that you feel affects the security of this module to

Please do not log security concerns as GitHub issues, as that could alert attackers to a potential flaw. If you want to nudge us beyond the email to **security@snyk.io**, tell us you sent such an email (without the details) on another channel, such as:
* An issue here on GitHub, with an email address we can use to contact you
  for a more detailed report.
* Send an email to support@snyk.io
* Message [@snyksec](https://twitter.com/snyksec) on Twitter.
